# Checking for Tenders

This project is simply to familiarize myself with Django and Bootstrap. Many features will be unnecessary, but this project simply gives me a base to experiment and play around with Django, HTML, Javascript, CSS etc. In short, this web app simply checks if 'chicken breast tenderloins' are currently on the menu for the day at Haverford's dining center.
